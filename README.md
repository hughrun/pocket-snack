When your Pocket list is overwhelming, pocket-snack lets you see just what you can read today

The basic idea is that each time the script runs it moves everything in `My List` to `Archive` with a `TBR` tag, then randomly selects X number of items to go back into `My List` so that instead of an overwhelming number of things to be read, you just have the number you can comfortably expect to read per cycle (day, week etc).
